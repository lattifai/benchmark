[APPLAUSE]

00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:22.398
&gt;&gt; MIRA MURATI: Hi everyone.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.934
Thank you, thank you.  It is

00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:25.668
great to have you here today.

00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:28.205
Today, I am going to talk about

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:31.641
three things.  That is it.  We

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:36.146
will start with why it is so

00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:37.147
important to us to have a

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:38.181
product that we can make truly

00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:42.185
available and broadly available

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.819
to everyone.  And we are always

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:43.853
trying to find out ways to

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:48.358
reduce friction.  So everyone

00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:49.259
can use ChatGPT wherever they

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.025
are.  Today, we will be

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.232
releasing the desktop version

00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:55.865
of ChatGPT and to make it

00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:58.367
simpler to use and much more

00:00:55.966 --> 00:01:00.136
natural as well.  But the big

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:00.803
news today is that we are

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:05.274
launching our new flagship

00:01:01.871 --> 00:01:09.579
model.  And we are calling it

00:01:05.374 --> 00:01:12.415
GPT-4o.  Best thing about

00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:18.922
GPT-4o is it brain GPT-4

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:19.622
intelligence to everyone

00:01:19.022 --> 00:01:20.490
including our free users.  We

00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:21.156
will be showing some live demos

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.525
today to show the full extent

00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:23.459
of the capabilities of our new

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.962
model.  And we will be rolling

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:32.134
them out over the next few

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:33.503
weeks.  So let's get started.

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:34.571
A very important part of our

00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:38.974
mission is to be able to make

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:41.710
our advanced AI tools available

00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:47.017
to everyone for free.  We think

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.683
it is very, very important that

00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:48.518
people having for what the

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:52.888
technology can do.  We really

00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:53.790
want to pair it with its

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:55.958
broader understanding.  And

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.059
were always finding ways to

00:01:56.058 --> 00:02:01.731
reduce the friction.  Recently,

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.365
we made ChatGPT available

00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:03.733
without the sign-up flow.

00:02:02.732 --> 00:02:08.337
Today, we are also bringing the

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:09.172
best to ChatGPT.  We want you

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:15.111
to be able to use it wherever

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:15.711
you are.  As you can see it is

00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:16.513
easy, simple, it integrates

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:17.613
very, very easily in your

00:02:16.613 --> 00:02:26.889
workflow.  Along with it, we

00:02:17.713 --> 00:02:27.557
have also refreshed the UI.  We

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.491
note that this model get more

00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:29.526
and more complex.  But we want

00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:31.328
the experience of interaction

00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:36.599
to actually become more

00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:37.266
natural, easy, and for you not

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:38.702
to focus on the UI at all but

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:41.905
focus on the collaboration of

00:02:38.802 --> 00:02:45.374
ChatGPT.  And now the big news.

00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:51.014
Today, we are releasing our

00:02:45.474 --> 00:02:57.253
newest flagship model this is

00:02:51.114 --> 00:03:01.558
GPT-4o.  [APPLAUSE]

00:02:57.353 --> 00:03:02.191
GPT-4o provides GPT-4

00:03:01.658 --> 00:03:04.727
intelligence but it is much

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:07.931
faster.  And it improves on its

00:03:04.827 --> 00:03:13.636
capabilities across text,

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:14.604
vision, and audio.  For the

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:15.638
past couple of years, we have

00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:16.673
been very focused on improving

00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:18.641
the intelligence of this model

00:03:16.773 --> 00:03:19.509
is.  And they have gotten

00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:22.245
pretty good.  But this is the

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.979
first time that we are really

00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:29.518
making a huge step forward when

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:30.452
it comes to the ease of use.

00:03:29.618 --> 00:03:31.387
This is incredibly important

00:03:30.552 --> 00:03:34.057
because we are looking at the

00:03:31.487 --> 00:03:34.790
future of interaction between

00:03:34.157 --> 00:03:40.663
ourselves and the machines.  We

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.698
think that GPT-4o is really

00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:45.501
shifting the paradigm into the

00:03:42.165 --> 00:03:58.147
future of collaboration.  It is

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:59.015
natural and far easier.  Making

00:03:58.247 --> 00:03:59.749
this happen is actually quite

00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:00.650
complex.  When we interact with

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.684
one another there is a lot of

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.519
stuff that we take for granted.

00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:04.020
You know the ease of our

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.021
dialogue when we interrupt

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.227
another, the background noises,

00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:11.961
the multiple voices in a

00:04:11.327 --> 00:04:12.795
conversation and understanding

00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:16.466
the tone of voice.  All of

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:20.836
these things are quite complex.

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:21.604
Until now with voice mode, we

00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:23.540
had three models that come

00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:24.140
together to deliver this

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.411
experience.  We have

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.045
transcription, intelligence,

00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:30.379
and text to speech all comes

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:36.185
together and orchestration to

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.086
deliver voice mode.  This also

00:04:36.285 --> 00:04:38.121
brings a lot of latency to the

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:41.691
experience and it really breaks

00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:42.358
the immersion in the

00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:45.628
collaboration with ChatGPT.

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:47.563
But now with GPT-4o this all

00:04:45.728 --> 00:04:51.600
happens natively.  GPT-4o

00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:56.840
reasons across voice, text, and

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.874
vision.  And with this

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:06.950
incredible efficiencies, it

00:04:57.974 --> 00:05:07.650
also allows us to bring the

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.584
GPT-4o intelligence to our free

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.151
users.  This is something we

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:10.086
have been trying to do for

00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:12.121
many, many months.  And we are

00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:12.755
very, very excited to finally

00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:18.027
bring GPT-4o to all of our users.
