Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.71,0:00:13.16,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,Hi everyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.52,0:00:15.99,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,Hi everyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.41,0:00:17.49,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,Thank you, thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.34,0:00:20.07,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,It's great to have you here today.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.79,0:00:23.02,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,Today, I am going to talk about three things.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.51,0:00:23.98,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,That's it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.63,0:00:33.43,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,We will start with why it's so important to us to have a product that we can make freely available and broadly available to everyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.25,0:00:38.10,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And we're always trying to find out ways to reduce friction.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.39,0:00:41.10,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,So everyone can use ChatGPT wherever they're.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.50,0:00:51.75,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,So today, we'll be releasing the desktop version of ChatGPT and the refreshed UI, that makes it simpler to use much more natural as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.18,0:00:57.71,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,But the big news today is that we're launching our new flagship model.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.58,0:01:00.87,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And we're calling it GPT-4o.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.03,0:01:11.05,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,The special thing about GPT-4o is that it brings GPT-4 level intelligence to everyone including our free users.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.94,0:01:18.17,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,We'll be showing some live demos today to show the full extent of the capabilities of our new model.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.82,0:01:22.61,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And we'll be rolling them out iteratively over the next few weeks.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.71,0:01:25.90,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,All right. So let's get started.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.35,0:01:35.59,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,A very important part of our mission is to be able to make our advanced AI tools available to everyone for free.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.72,0:01:42.92,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,We think it's very, very important that people have an intuitive feel for what the technology can do.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.36,0:01:47.79,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And so we really want to pair it with this broader understanding.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.71,0:01:55.85,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And we're always finding ways to reduce the friction and recently, we made ChatGPT available without the sign-up flow.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.14,0:02:05.56,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And today, we're also bringing the desktop app to ChatGPT, because we want you to be able to use it wherever you're.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.95,0:02:11.84,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,As you can see it's easy, it's simple, it integrates very, very easily in your workflow.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.98,0:02:16.49,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,Along with it, we have also refreshed the UI.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.89,0:02:21.20,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,We note that these models get more and more complex.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.67,0:02:34.61,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,But we want the experience of interaction to actually become more natural, easy, and for you not to focus on the UI at all but just focus on the collaboration with ChatGPT.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.96,0:02:38.00,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And now the big news.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.00,0:02:45.02,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,Today, we're releasing our newest flagship model, this is GPT-4o.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.05,0:02:58.46,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,GPT-4o provides GPT-4 level intelligence, but it is much faster.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.28,0:03:04.55,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And it improves on its capabilities across text, vision, and audio.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.78,0:03:10.97,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,For the past couple of years, we've been very focused on improving the intelligence of these models.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.37,0:03:13.06,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And they've gotten pretty good.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.07,0:03:20.50,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,But this is the first time that we're really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.87,0:03:30.20,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And this is incredibly important, because we're looking at the future of interaction between ourselves and the machines.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.68,0:03:42.60,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And we think that GPT-4o is really shifting that paradigm into the future of collaboration, where this interaction becomes much more natural and far, far easier.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.42,0:03:52.53,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,But you know, making this happen is actually quite complex, because when we interact with one another there's a lot of stuff that we take for granted.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.90,0:04:05.76,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,You know the ease of our dialog when we interrupt one another, the background noises, the multiple voices in a conversation, or, you know, understanding the tone of voice.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.46,0:04:10.32,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,All of these things are actually quite complex for, for these models.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.81,0:04:18.67,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And until now, with voice mode, we had three models that come together to deliver this experience.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.22,0:04:23.12,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,We have transcription, intelligence, and then text to speech.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.50,0:04:27.15,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,All comes together in orchestration to deliver voice mode.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.00,0:04:37.02,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,This also brings a lot of latency to the experience, and it really breaks that immersion in the collaboration with ChatGPT.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.00,0:04:42.11,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,But now, with GPT-4o, this all happens natively.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.04,0:04:48.70,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,GPT-4o reasons across voice, text, and vision.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.41,0:04:59.31,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And with these incredible efficiencies, it also allows us to bring the GPT-4o class intelligence to our free users.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.80,0:05:03.48,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,This is something that we've been trying to do for many, many months.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.93,0:05:09.74,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And we're very, very excited to finally bring GPT-4o to all of our users.
