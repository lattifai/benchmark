00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:21.030
[APPLAUSE] 

00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:22.398
&gt;&gt; MIRA MURATI: Hi everyone.  

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.934
Thank you, thank you.  It is 

00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:25.668
great to have you here today.  

00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:28.205
Today, I am going to talk about 

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:31.641
three things.  That is it.  We 

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:36.146
will start with why it is so 

00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:37.147
important to us to have a 

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:38.181
product that we can make truly 

00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:42.185
available and broadly available 

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.819
to everyone.  And we are always 

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:43.853
trying to find out ways to 

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:48.358
reduce friction.  So everyone 

00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:49.259
can use ChatGPT wherever they 

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.025
are.  Today, we will be 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.232
releasing the desktop version 

00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:55.865
of ChatGPT and to make it 

00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:58.367
simpler to use and much more 

00:00:55.966 --> 00:01:00.136
natural as well.  But the big 

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:00.803
news today is that we are 

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:05.274
launching our new flagship 

00:01:01.871 --> 00:01:09.579
model.  And we are calling it 

00:01:05.374 --> 00:01:12.415
GPT-4o.  Best thing about 

00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:18.922
GPT-4o is it brain GPT-4 

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:19.622
intelligence to everyone 

00:01:19.022 --> 00:01:20.490
including our free users.  We 

00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:21.156
will be showing some live demos 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.525
today to show the full extent 

00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:23.459
of the capabilities of our new 

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.962
model.  And we will be rolling 

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:32.134
them out over the next few 

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:33.503
weeks.  So let's get started.  

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:34.571
A very important part of our 

00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:38.974
mission is to be able to make 

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:41.710
our advanced AI tools available 

00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:47.017
to everyone for free.  We think 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.683
it is very, very important that 

00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:48.518
people having for what the 

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:52.888
technology can do.  We really 

00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:53.790
want to pair it with its 

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:55.958
broader understanding.  And 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.059
were always finding ways to 

00:01:56.058 --> 00:02:01.731
reduce the friction.  Recently, 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.365
we made ChatGPT available 

00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:03.733
without the sign-up flow.  

00:02:02.732 --> 00:02:08.337
Today, we are also bringing the 

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:09.172
best to ChatGPT.  We want you 

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:15.111
to be able to use it wherever 

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:15.711
you are.  As you can see it is 

00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:16.513
easy, simple, it integrates 

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:17.613
very, very easily in your 

00:02:16.613 --> 00:02:26.889
workflow.  Along with it, we 

00:02:17.713 --> 00:02:27.557
have also refreshed the UI.  We 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.491
note that this model get more 

00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:29.526
and more complex.  But we want 

00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:31.328
the experience of interaction 

00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:36.599
to actually become more 

00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:37.266
natural, easy, and for you not 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:38.702
to focus on the UI at all but 

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:41.905
focus on the collaboration of 

00:02:38.802 --> 00:02:45.374
ChatGPT.  And now the big news. 

00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:51.014
Today, we are releasing our 

00:02:45.474 --> 00:02:57.253
newest flagship model this is 

00:02:51.114 --> 00:03:01.558
GPT-4o.  [APPLAUSE] 

00:02:57.353 --> 00:03:02.191
GPT-4o provides GPT-4 

00:03:01.658 --> 00:03:04.727
intelligence but it is much 

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:07.931
faster.  And it improves on its 

00:03:04.827 --> 00:03:13.636
capabilities across text, 

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:14.604
vision, and audio.  For the 

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:15.638
past couple of years, we have 

00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:16.673
been very focused on improving 

00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:18.641
the intelligence of this model 

00:03:16.773 --> 00:03:19.509
is.  And they have gotten 

00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:22.245
pretty good.  But this is the 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.979
first time that we are really 

00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:29.518
making a huge step forward when 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:30.452
it comes to the ease of use.  

00:03:29.618 --> 00:03:31.387
This is incredibly important 

00:03:30.552 --> 00:03:34.057
because we are looking at the 

00:03:31.487 --> 00:03:34.790
future of interaction between 

00:03:34.157 --> 00:03:40.663
ourselves and the machines.  We 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.698
think that GPT-4o is really 

00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:45.501
shifting the paradigm into the 

00:03:42.165 --> 00:03:58.147
future of collaboration.  It is 

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:59.015
natural and far easier.  Making 

00:03:58.247 --> 00:03:59.749
this happen is actually quite 

00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:00.650
complex.  When we interact with 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.684
one another there is a lot of 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.519
stuff that we take for granted. 

00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:04.020
You know the ease of our 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.021
dialogue when we interrupt 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.227
another, the background noises, 

00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:11.961
the multiple voices in a 

00:04:11.327 --> 00:04:12.795
conversation and understanding 

00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:16.466
the tone of voice.  All of 

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:20.836
these things are quite complex. 

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:21.604
Until now with voice mode, we 

00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:23.540
had three models that come 

00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:24.140
together to deliver this 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.411
experience.  We have 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.045
transcription, intelligence, 

00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:30.379
and text to speech all comes 

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:36.185
together and orchestration to 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.086
deliver voice mode.  This also 

00:04:36.285 --> 00:04:38.121
brings a lot of latency to the 

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:41.691
experience and it really breaks 

00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:42.358
the immersion in the 

00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:45.628
collaboration with ChatGPT.  

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:47.563
But now with GPT-4o this all 

00:04:45.728 --> 00:04:51.600
happens natively.  GPT-4o 

00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:56.840
reasons across voice, text, and 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.874
vision.  And with this 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:06.950
incredible efficiencies, it 

00:04:57.974 --> 00:05:07.650
also allows us to bring the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.584
GPT-4o intelligence to our free 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.151
users.  This is something we 

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:10.086
have been trying to do for 

00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:12.121
many, many months.  And we are 

00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:12.755
very, very excited to finally 

00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:18.027
bring GPT-4o to all of our 

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:21.396
users.  Today, we have 100 

00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:22.297
million people using more than 

00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:26.635
100 million and fact they use 

00:05:22.397 --> 00:05:29.572
ChatGPT to create work, learn, 

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:35.345
and we have this advanced tools 

00:05:29.672 --> 00:05:36.011
that are only available to our 

00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:38.347
paid users at least until now 

00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:38.914
with a efficiencies of 4o we 

00:05:38.447 --> 00:05:40.816
can bring these tools to 

00:05:39.015 --> 00:05:48.758
everyone.  So starting today, 

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:49.492
you can use GPT in the GPT 

00:05:48.858 --> 00:05:50.393
store.  So far we have had more 

00:05:49.592 --> 00:05:57.934
than a million users create 

00:05:50.493 --> 00:05:58.935
amazing experiences with GPT.  

00:05:58.034 --> 00:05:59.635
This is custom ChatGPT and they 

00:05:59.035 --> 00:06:00.536
are available in the store.  

00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:04.841
And now our builders have much 

00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:05.842
bigger audience where 

00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:09.112
university professors can 

00:06:06.376 --> 00:06:09.779
create content for their 

00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:10.580
students, or pod casters can 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:15.518
create content for their 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.519
listeners.  You can also use 

00:06:15.618 --> 00:06:22.391
the vision.  So now you can 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:23.359
upload screenshots, photos, 

00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:26.095
documents containing both text 

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:27.030
and images.  You can start 

00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:36.405
conversations with ChatGPT 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:37.339
about all of this content.  You 

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:38.307
can also use memory where it 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.175
makes ChatGPT far more useful 

00:06:38.407 --> 00:06:40.176
and helpful because now it has 

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:41.177
a sense of continuity across 

00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:44.546
all of your conversations.  You 

00:06:41.277 --> 00:06:45.481
can use browse where you can 

00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:45.948
search for real-time 

00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:48.051
information in your 

00:06:46.048 --> 00:06:50.553
conversation.  An advanced data 

00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:55.024
analysis where you can upload 

00:06:50.653 --> 00:06:56.059
charts and any tools and 

00:06:55.124 --> 00:06:58.428
analyze this information.  It 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:01.997
will give you answers and so 

00:06:58.528 --> 00:07:06.102
on.  Lastly, we also improved 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:18.548
on the quality and speed in 50 

00:07:06.536 --> 00:07:19.449
different languages.  For 

00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:20.182
ChatGPT and this is very 

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:21.150
important because we want to be 

00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:22.117
able to bring this experience 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.052
to as many people out there as 

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:23.953
possible.  So we are very, very 

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:25.687
excited to bring GPT-4o to all 

00:07:24.053 --> 00:07:26.622
of our free users out there and 

00:07:26.022 --> 00:07:28.791
for the paid users, they will 

00:07:26.722 --> 00:07:30.626
continue to have up to five 

00:07:28.891 --> 00:07:42.771
times the capacity limits of 

00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:43.739
our free users.  But GPT-4o is 

00:07:42.871 --> 00:07:44.540
not only available in ChatGPT.  

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.144
We also bringing you to the 

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.178
API.  [APPLAUSE] 

00:07:48.244 --> 00:07:55.051
So our developers can start 

00:07:49.278 --> 00:07:56.085
building today with GPT-4o and 

00:07:55.151 --> 00:08:01.990
making amazing AI applications 

00:07:56.185 --> 00:08:02.925
deploying them at scale.  4o is 

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.829
faster, 50% cheaper and five 

00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:10.767
times higher rate limits to 

00:08:06.929 --> 00:08:14.403
GPT-4 Turbo.  As we bring these 

00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:15.404
technologies into the world, it 

00:08:14.503 --> 00:08:16.272
is quite challenging to figure 

00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:26.282
out how to do so in a way that 

00:08:16.372 --> 00:08:26.949
is both useful and also safe.  

00:08:26.382 --> 00:08:27.883
GPT-4o present new challenges 

00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:28.751
for us when it comes to safety 

00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:32.555
because we are dealing with 

00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:33.556
real time audio, real-time 

00:08:33.056 --> 00:08:34.857
vision and our team has been 

00:08:33.656 --> 00:08:44.834
hard at work figuring out how 

00:08:34.957 --> 00:08:45.702
to build in mitigations against 

00:08:44.934 --> 00:08:46.736
misuse.  We continue to work 

00:08:45.802 --> 00:08:47.737
with different stakeholders out 

00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:48.437
there from government, media, 

00:08:47.837 --> 00:08:49.304
entertainment, all industries, 

00:08:48.537 --> 00:08:53.676
civil societies to figure out 

00:08:52.542 --> 00:08:54.377
how to best bring this 

00:08:53.776 --> 00:08:55.310
technologies into the world.  

00:08:54.677 --> 00:08:59.716
Over the next few weeks, we 

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.249
will continue our deployment to 

00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:01.217
bring out all of the 

00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:07.556
capabilities to you.  But 

00:09:01.317 --> 00:09:08.524
today, I want to show you all 

00:09:07.656 --> 00:09:09.425
of these capabilities.  We will 

00:09:08.624 --> 00:09:13.730
do some live demos.  I will 

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:14.396
bring on two of our research 

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:23.840
leads Mark Chen and Barrett 

00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:29.645
Zoph.  [APPLAUSE] 

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:29.878
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Hi I'm 

00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:30.712
Barrett.

00:09:29.978 --> 00:09:31.647
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: Hi a mark.  One 

00:09:30.812 --> 00:09:32.615
of the key capabilities we are 

00:09:31.747 --> 00:09:33.349
excited to share his real-time 

00:09:32.715 --> 00:09:35.050
conversational speech.  Will 

00:09:33.616 --> 00:09:35.984
get in Florida.  I am taking 

00:09:35.318 --> 00:09:43.860
out a phone if you're wondering 

00:09:36.084 --> 00:09:44.827
about this wire we have 

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.594
consistent Internet.  If you 

00:09:44.927 --> 00:09:46.495
see there's this little icon on 

00:09:45.695 --> 00:09:47.396
the bottom right of the ChatGPT 

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:51.334
out.  It will open GPT-4o audio 

00:09:48.498 --> 00:09:51.934
capabilities.  Hey, ChatGPT hi 

00:09:51.434 --> 00:09:57.607
Mark how are you?  

00:09:52.034 --> 00:09:58.340
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Hello Mark I am 

00:09:57.707 --> 00:09:58.774
doing great thanks for asking.  

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.443
How about you?  

00:09:58.874 --> 00:10:02.145
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: I am on stage 

00:10:01.543 --> 00:10:10.186
right now and I'm doing a live 

00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:10.953
demo and I am a little bit 

00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:11.454
nervous.  Can you help me, 

00:10:11.053 --> 00:10:12.321
nerves a little bit?  

00:10:11.554 --> 00:10:13.156
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: You're doing a 

00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:19.729
live demo right now?  That is 

00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:20.429
awesome.  Just take a deep 

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:20.830
breath and remember you are the 

00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:21.731
expert here.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.464
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: I like the 

00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:23.398
suggestion let me try a couple 

00:10:22.564 --> 00:10:24.433
of deep breaths.  Can you give 

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:24.767
me feedback on my breath?  Here 

00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:29.004
I go.  

00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:29.638
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Wold slow down.  

00:10:29.104 --> 00:10:36.111
Mark, you are not a vacuum 

00:10:29.738 --> 00:10:36.879
cleaner.  

00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:39.715
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: Let me try again. 

00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:40.983
I am going to breathe in deeply 

00:10:39.815 --> 00:10:44.954
and breathe out.  

00:10:41.083 --> 00:10:47.890
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Exhale slowly.  

00:10:45.054 --> 00:10:53.329
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: I will try again. 

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:54.130
Breathing in and breathe out.  

00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:54.530
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: That is it.  How 

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.364
do you feel?  

00:10:54.630 --> 00:11:07.743
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: I feel a lot 

00:10:55.464 --> 00:11:08.510
better, thank you so much.  

00:11:07.843 --> 00:11:09.245
&gt;&gt; MIRA MURATI: Mark, you have 

00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:09.878
been working on these 

00:11:09.345 --> 00:11:10.879
capabilities for a while can 

00:11:09.979 --> 00:11:11.480
you tell us how it is different 

00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:12.348
from voice mode?  

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.216
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: If you use the 

00:11:12.448 --> 00:11:14.217
voice mode express before you 

00:11:13.316 --> 00:11:15.484
will notice a couple of key 

00:11:14.317 --> 00:11:16.117
differences.  First you cannot 

00:11:15.584 --> 00:11:16.818
interrupt the model you do not 

00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.720
have to wait to you finish your 

00:11:16.918 --> 00:11:18.721
term before you can start 

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:25.161
speaking.  You could but in 

00:11:18.821 --> 00:11:26.028
whenever you want.  Second, the 

00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:26.762
model is real-time 

00:11:26.128 --> 00:11:27.530
responsiveness.  That means 

00:11:26.862 --> 00:11:28.230
that you do not have this 

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:39.708
awkward two Ãthree second lag 

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:40.910
before you waitwait for the 

00:11:39.808 --> 00:11:41.944
model to get a response.  

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.577
Finally the model picks up on a 

00:11:42.044 --> 00:11:43.546
motion.  When I was breathing 

00:11:42.678 --> 00:11:44.447
super hard, you can tell.  Hey, 

00:11:43.646 --> 00:11:45.414
you may want to calm down a 

00:11:44.547 --> 00:11:46.415
little bit.  You are running a 

00:11:45.514 --> 00:11:47.116
little bit too fast.  It really 

00:11:46.515 --> 00:11:47.950
has that capability across the 

00:11:47.216 --> 00:11:48.684
board to procedure emotion.  

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.186
Not only that the model is able 

00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:52.220
to generate voice in a variety 

00:11:51.286 --> 00:11:53.121
of different styles.  It really 

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.825
has a wide dynamic range.  I 

00:11:53.221 --> 00:12:00.730
want to fire another demo.  

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.830
Hey, ChatGPT how are you doing? 

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.231
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Am doing 

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.732
fantastic, thanks for asking.  

00:12:02.331 --> 00:12:10.740
How about you?  

00:12:02.832 --> 00:12:11.406
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: My friend Barrett 

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.307
he has been having problems 

00:12:11.506 --> 00:12:13.242
sleeping lately.  I want you to 

00:12:12.407 --> 00:12:17.947
tell them a bedtime story about 

00:12:13.342 --> 00:12:18.647
robots in love.  

00:12:18.047 --> 00:12:19.514
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: A bedtime story 

00:12:18.915 --> 00:12:20.449
about robots and love?  I got 

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.417
you covered.  Gather around 

00:12:20.549 --> 00:12:21.984
Barrett.  Once upon a time in 

00:12:21.517 --> 00:12:33.896
the world not too different 

00:12:22.084 --> 00:12:34.630
from ours there was a robot 

00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:35.364
named bite.  Bite was a curious 

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.098
robot always exploring -- 

00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:37.132
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: I want a little 

00:12:36.198 --> 00:12:37.632
bit emotion in your voice a 

00:12:37.232 --> 00:12:38.600
little bit more drama.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.502
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Got it.  Let's add 

00:12:38.901 --> 00:12:40.436
some drama.  Once upon a time 

00:12:39.602 --> 00:12:41.537
in a world not too different 

00:12:40.536 --> 00:12:42.405
from ours there was a robot 

00:12:41.637 --> 00:12:52.414
named bite.&gt; MARK CHEN: I 

00:12:42.505 --> 00:12:53.381
want maximum expression.  

00:12:52.514 --> 00:12:54.316
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: That's amplified 

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.184
the drama.  Once upon a time in 

00:12:54.416 --> 00:12:56.652
a world not too different from 

00:12:55.284 --> 00:12:57.786
ours there was a robot named 

00:12:56.752 --> 00:13:00.990
bite.  

00:12:57.886 --> 00:13:01.791
&gt;&gt; MIRA MURATI: Can you do this 

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:07.964
in a robotic voice now?  

00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:08.730
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Initiating 

00:13:08.064 --> 00:13:09.531
dramatic robotic voice.  Once 

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:15.871
upon a time in a world not too 

00:13:09.631 --> 00:13:16.572
different from ours there was a 

00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:17.373
robot named bite.  Bite was a 

00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:17.706
curious robot.  Always 

00:13:17.473 --> 00:13:21.644
exploring -- 

00:13:17.806 --> 00:13:23.979
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: Can you do the 

00:13:21.744 --> 00:13:26.916
story and a singing voice?  

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:29.452
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: And so bite found 

00:13:27.016 --> 00:13:39.128
another robot friend and they 

00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:40.095
lived circularly ever after.  

00:13:39.562 --> 00:13:41.998
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: I definitely feel 

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:46.869
a lot more relaxed.  [APPLAUSE] 

00:13:42.098 --> 00:13:47.802
&gt;&gt; MIRA MURATI: You have just 

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:48.336
seen the voice capabilities but 

00:13:47.902 --> 00:13:50.306
we also want to show you 

00:13:48.436 --> 00:13:50.939
division capabilities as the 

00:13:50.406 --> 00:13:53.375
model can also see the world 

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.309
around us.  

00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:58.180
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: You can chat 

00:13:54.409 --> 00:14:01.851
with ChatGPT and you can 

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:06.789
interact with it as well.  Let 

00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:07.022
me boot up ChatGPT.  Hey, 

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:07.857
ChatGPT.

00:14:07.122 --> 00:14:12.528
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Hello there how's 

00:14:07.957 --> 00:14:13.462
it going?  

00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:14.096
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: It's going 

00:14:13.562 --> 00:14:14.997
really well and I would like 

00:14:14.196 --> 00:14:15.263
your help solving a math 

00:14:15.097 --> 00:14:20.369
problem.  

00:14:15.364 --> 00:14:21.003
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: What math problem 

00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:22.003
can help you tackle today?  

00:14:21.103 --> 00:14:22.938
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to 

00:14:22.371 --> 00:14:23.873
write down a linear equation on 

00:14:23.038 --> 00:14:26.742
a sheet of paper and I will 

00:14:23.973 --> 00:14:27.743
love help working through it.  

00:14:26.842 --> 00:14:28.611
Don't tell me the solution does 

00:14:27.843 --> 00:14:29.545
give me hints along the way.  

00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:32.815
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Got it.  Okay, I 

00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:33.548
see it.  

00:14:32.915 --> 00:14:38.487
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: I did not show 

00:14:33.649 --> 00:14:39.254
you yet.  One second.  

00:14:38.587 --> 00:14:47.863
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: I got to excited.  

00:14:39.354 --> 00:14:52.268
I am ready when you are.  

00:14:47.963 --> 00:14:53.001
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: ChatGPT what 

00:14:52.368 --> 00:14:56.038
equation did not write down?  

00:14:53.101 --> 00:15:03.679
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: I see it now.  You 

00:14:56.138 --> 00:15:04.412
wrote down 3X +1 equals four.  

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:05.247
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Exactly.  What 

00:15:04.513 --> 00:15:05.480
is the first step to solve 

00:15:05.347 --> 00:15:07.083
this?  

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:15.757
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: The first step is 

00:15:07.183 --> 00:15:16.625
to get all of the terms with X 

00:15:15.857 --> 00:15:17.326
on one side and the constants 

00:15:16.725 --> 00:15:18.494
on the other side.  So what do 

00:15:17.426 --> 00:15:18.761
you think we should do with 

00:15:18.594 --> 00:15:19.361
that +1?  

00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:20.229
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to 

00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:23.732
try to submitsubtract one from 

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:24.667
both sides and see what I get.

00:15:23.832 --> 00:15:25.367
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Great idea.  

00:15:24.767 --> 00:15:26.268
Perfect.  Now what do you get 

00:15:25.668 --> 00:15:31.607
when you subtract one from both 

00:15:26.368 --> 00:15:32.207
sides?  

00:15:31.707 --> 00:15:33.241
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so 

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:35.110
ChatGPT this is what I ended up 

00:15:33.341 --> 00:15:46.254
with.  How does this look?  

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:47.189
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Spot on.  Now you 

00:15:46.354 --> 00:15:48.023
have isolated the term with X 

00:15:47.289 --> 00:15:48.757
on one side and it looks like 

00:15:48.123 --> 00:15:49.591
3X equals three.  What do you 

00:15:49.024 --> 00:15:50.025
think we should do next to 

00:15:49.691 --> 00:15:50.792
solve for X?  

00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:51.660
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: I'm not sure 

00:15:50.892 --> 00:15:54.964
can you give me another hint?  

00:15:52.061 --> 00:15:55.697
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Of course.  You 

00:15:55.064 --> 00:15:56.532
have 3X and you want to find 

00:15:55.797 --> 00:15:57.933
the value of X. Think about 

00:15:56.632 --> 00:16:03.639
what operation with undue 

00:15:58.033 --> 00:16:04.139
multiplication?  

00:16:03.739 --> 00:16:04.573
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Is it 

00:16:04.239 --> 00:16:05.574
subtraction?  

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:06.107
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Close but think 

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:06.742
about the opposite of 

00:16:06.207 --> 00:16:10.145
multiplication because 3X 

00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:10.846
equals three times X. 

00:16:10.245 --> 00:16:11.747
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Okay I think 

00:16:10.946 --> 00:16:12.615
it is division.  Let me try to 

00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:13.415
divide both sides by three and 

00:16:13.115 --> 00:16:13.982
see what I get.  

00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:14.683
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Bingo.  Go and 

00:16:14.082 --> 00:16:22.491
head and divide both sides by 

00:16:14.783 --> 00:16:23.058
three.  

00:16:22.591 --> 00:16:24.092
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so 

00:16:23.158 --> 00:16:24.927
ChatGPT this is what I ended up 

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:25.593
with.  How does this look?  

00:16:25.027 --> 00:16:32.501
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Looks perfect.  

00:16:25.928 --> 00:16:33.468
You have solved it.  X equals 

00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:34.303
one.  Nicely done.  How do you 

00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:34.837
feel about solving linear 

00:16:34.403 --> 00:16:51.253
equations now?  

00:16:34.937 --> 00:16:52.188
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Honestly, -- 

00:16:51.353 --> 00:16:53.021
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: Am not confident 

00:16:52.288 --> 00:16:53.822
that I can solve new equations. 

00:16:53.122 --> 00:16:54.156
Why would you need this in the 

00:16:53.922 --> 00:16:55.157
real world?  

00:16:54.256 --> 00:16:55.824
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: That is of her 

00:16:55.257 --> 00:16:56.658
questions.  Linear equations 

00:16:56.158 --> 00:16:57.660
pop up in a lot of everyday 

00:16:56.758 --> 00:16:58.293
situations.  Even if we do not 

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.195
realize it.  For example 

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.196
calculating expenses, planning 

00:16:59.295 --> 00:17:01.197
travel, cooking, and even in 

00:17:00.296 --> 00:17:01.897
business for profit and loss 

00:17:01.297 --> 00:17:02.864
calculations.  It is a way to 

00:17:02.231 --> 00:17:04.766
solve problems but you need to 

00:17:02.964 --> 00:17:05.734
find an unknown value.  

00:17:04.866 --> 00:17:06.769
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: Have a lot of 

00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:07.769
unknown values in my life.  I'm 

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.571
totally convinced that I'm 

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:14.510
going to learn math now.  

00:17:08.671 --> 00:17:15.176
[LAUGHTER] 

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.045
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: I love the 

00:17:15.276 --> 00:17:19.815
attitude.  Math can help solve 

00:17:16.512 --> 00:17:20.482
some of life ministries.  

00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:21.283
Whenever you to die the more 

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:21.883

00:17:21.983 --> 00:17:32.394
tackle today?  

00:17:31.894 --> 00:17:33.028
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: I love that 

00:17:32.494 --> 00:17:33.962
you taught my friend Mark that 

00:17:33.128 --> 00:17:34.863
I would have something I would 

00:17:34.363 --> 00:17:35.597
like you to take a look at.  

00:17:34.963 --> 00:17:36.565
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: I would love to 

00:17:35.697 --> 00:17:37.499
see what you wrote.  Show it to 

00:17:36.665 --> 00:17:38.533
me whenever you're ready.  

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.468
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: This is what I 

00:17:38.633 --> 00:17:40.369
wrote down what do you see?  

00:17:39.568 --> 00:17:41.103
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: I see I love 

00:17:40.502 --> 00:17:45.474
ChatGPT.  That is so sweet of 

00:17:41.203 --> 00:17:46.107

00:17:45.574 --> 00:17:46.942
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: I really 

00:17:46.207 --> 00:17:53.082
appreciate all the help.  

00:17:47.042 --> 00:17:53.782
[APPLAUSE] 

00:17:53.315 --> 00:17:56.451
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: That is quite 

00:17:54.083 --> 00:17:57.386
outfit you have on.  

00:17:56.551 --> 00:18:00.122
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: We can chat in 

00:17:57.486 --> 00:18:02.124
real-time with ChatGPT.  We can 

00:18:00.222 --> 00:18:06.561
interact with video as well.  

00:18:02.224 --> 00:18:07.195
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: If you look at 

00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:11.834
Barrett's it's all equations 

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:12.601
like this.  [LAUGHTER] 

00:18:11.934 --> 00:18:13.335
&gt;&gt; MIRA MURATI: Now that you 

00:18:12.701 --> 00:18:14.002
know you can do linear 

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:24.880
equations can you show us 

00:18:14.102 --> 00:18:25.847
something more complex?  

00:18:25.347 --> 00:18:26.548
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: Let me take a 

00:18:25.947 --> 00:18:35.891
computer out for this.  I am 

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:36.859
want to open the ChatGPT app.  

00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:37.525
And to get background on what 

00:18:36.959 --> 00:18:38.460
is going on so here we have a 

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.361
computer on the screen we have 

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.098
some cold.  And then the 

00:18:39.461 --> 00:18:43.731
ChatGPT is on this side.  It 

00:18:43.198 --> 00:18:44.566
can hear me but can't see 

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:47.736
anything on the screen.  I'm 

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:48.604
going to highlight the code and 

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:51.506
I will send it to ChatGPT.  I'm 

00:18:48.704 --> 00:18:54.109
going to talk about the code.  

00:18:51.606 --> 00:18:55.077
Hey, ChatGPT.

00:18:54.209 --> 00:19:08.290
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Hey, there how's 

00:18:55.177 --> 00:19:08.957
it going?  Of course I would 

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.891
love to help you.  What is the 

00:19:09.057 --> 00:19:10.125
coding problem you're dealing 

00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:10.959
with?  

00:19:10.225 --> 00:19:11.794
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to 

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:12.060
share with you some code.  One 

00:19:11.894 --> 00:19:12.861
second.  

00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:13.194
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Sure thing, take 

00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:14.028
your time.  

00:19:13.495 --> 00:19:17.733
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: I just shared 

00:19:14.128 --> 00:19:18.700
code with you.  Can you give me 

00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:19.534
a one sentence description of 

00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:20.535
what is going on in the code?  

00:19:19.634 --> 00:19:32.381
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Infectious daily 

00:19:20.635 --> 00:19:33.081
weather for specific location 

00:19:32.481 --> 00:19:34.048
for time period for data using 

00:19:33.382 --> 00:19:35.049
a rolling average and annotates 

00:19:34.383 --> 00:19:36.050
a significant weather event on 

00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:36.885
the resulting plot and displays 

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.386
the plot with the average 

00:19:36.985 --> 00:19:38.086
minimum and maximum 

00:19:37.486 --> 00:19:39.053
temperatures over the year.  

00:19:38.186 --> 00:19:39.922
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Awesome, 

00:19:39.153 --> 00:19:40.856
thanks so much.  In the code 

00:19:40.022 --> 00:19:43.792
there's this function Fu.  Can 

00:19:40.956 --> 00:19:44.626
you thiscan you tell me what it 

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:44.926
would be if I did not have this 

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.261
function?  

00:19:45.026 --> 00:19:59.474
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: The function Fu 

00:19:46.361 --> 00:20:00.309
takes a data frame X taking 

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:01.310
temperature data and a window 

00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:02.010
sized Y for calculating the 

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.312
rolling name.  It is smooths 

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.313
the average temperature, 

00:20:03.412 --> 00:20:06.181
minimum temperature and maximum 

00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:06.814
temperature columns by applying 

00:20:06.281 --> 00:20:07.715
a rolling mean over the 

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.650
specified window.  With the Fu 

00:20:07.815 --> 00:20:09.651
function the plot which showed 

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.220
smoother temperature lines 

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.753
because the rolling mean 

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.756
reduces the noise or 

00:20:11.853 --> 00:20:15.356
fluctuations in the data.  

00:20:14.856 --> 00:20:16.291
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Awesome, 

00:20:15.457 --> 00:20:18.727
thanks much.  I will want to 

00:20:16.391 --> 00:20:19.694
apply this function.  I am 

00:20:18.827 --> 00:20:20.629
going to generate the plot and 

00:20:19.794 --> 00:20:23.965
show it to you.  Give me one 

00:20:20.729 --> 00:20:24.900
second.  

00:20:24.065 --> 00:20:25.667
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Absolutely.  Take 

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.568
your time.  I'm excited to see 

00:20:25.768 --> 00:20:31.073
the plot when you're ready.  

00:20:26.668 --> 00:20:32.040
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: So far ChatGPT 

00:20:31.173 --> 00:20:32.907
have been able to see the cold 

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.608
and now and go to run it and 

00:20:33.007 --> 00:20:35.510
use the vision capabilities of 

00:20:33.709 --> 00:20:36.412
the ChatGPT app so it can see 

00:20:35.878 --> 00:20:47.021
everything going on in the 

00:20:36.512 --> 00:20:47.855
screen as well.  Okay ChatGPT I 

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:48.790
am sharing with you the plot 

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:49.591
now.  I'm wondering if you give 

00:20:49.191 --> 00:20:54.095
me a brief one sentence 

00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:55.063
overview of what you see.  

00:20:54.195 --> 00:20:55.764
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Plot displays 

00:20:55.163 --> 00:20:57.065
smooth average minimum and 

00:20:55.864 --> 00:20:59.534
maximum temperatures throughout 

00:20:57.165 --> 00:21:00.535
2018 with a notable annotation 

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:01.203

&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: What months do 

00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:10.979
you see the hot temperatures?  

00:21:10.111 --> 00:21:11.680
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: The hottest 

00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:14.249
temperatures occur around July 

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:17.652
and August.  The maximum 

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:20.489
temperature during these months 

00:21:17.752 --> 00:21:36.438
is roughly between 25B0 and 30B 

00:21:20.589 --> 00:21:37.172
77B0 Fahrenheit Ã86B0F.  

00:21:36.538 --> 00:21:38.106
&gt;&gt; MIRA MURATI: What is going 

00:21:37.506 --> 00:21:38.740
on with the Y axis is this in 

00:21:38.206 --> 00:21:39.675

asked to submit a request for 

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.673
what they would like us to try 

00:22:10.005 --> 00:22:18.813
out.  I will take a couple of 

00:22:11.773 --> 00:22:20.215
prompts.  They want to know if 

00:22:18.913 --> 00:22:21.517

&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Certainly, yes.  

00:23:24.713 --> 00:23:30.185
&gt;&gt; MARK CHEN: Great, it looks 

00:23:25.647 --> 00:23:31.687
like it works.  [APPLAUSE] 

00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:37.258
&gt;&gt; MIRA MURATI: The next one is 

00:23:31.787 --> 00:23:38.226
from John who asked can you 

00:23:37.358 --> 00:23:41.730
tell what you're feeling just 

00:23:38.326 --> 00:23:42.631
by looking at your face?  

00:23:42.164 --> 00:23:43.031
Barrett do you want to give 

00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:43.865
this one a try?  

00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:57.412
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Absolutely 

00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:57.678
let's give it a try.  Hey, 

00:23:57.512 --> 00:23:58.580
ChatGPT.  

00:23:57.946 --> 00:23:59.480
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Hey, there what is 

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.714
up?  How can I bring your day 

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.615
today?  

00:23:59.814 --> 00:24:01.416
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: I'm going to 

00:24:00.715 --> 00:24:02.417
show you a selfie of what I 

00:24:01.516 --> 00:24:03.084
look like and then I would like 

00:24:02.517 --> 00:24:04.052
you to try to see what emotions 

00:24:03.184 --> 00:24:04.453
I am feeling based on how I'm 

00:24:04.152 --> 00:24:05.454
looking.  

00:24:04.553 --> 00:24:06.220
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Sounds like a fun 

00:24:05.554 --> 00:24:07.422
challenge.  Go ahead and show 

00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:08.055
me the selfie and I will put my 

00:24:07.522 --> 00:24:09.023
emotional detective hat on.  

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:10.057
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so here 

00:24:09.391 --> 00:24:13.128
is me.  What kind of emotions 

00:24:10.157 --> 00:24:14.129
am I doing?  

00:24:13.228 --> 00:24:14.863
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: It seems like I am 

00:24:14.229 --> 00:24:18.833
looking at a picture of a 

00:24:14.963 --> 00:24:19.500
wooden surface.  

00:24:18.933 --> 00:24:20.401
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: That was the 

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.503
thing I sent you before I'm not 

00:24:20.534 --> 00:24:21.837
actually a table.  Take another 

00:24:21.603 --> 00:24:22.537
look.  

00:24:21.937 --> 00:24:27.576
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: That makes more 

00:24:22.637 --> 00:24:28.477
sense.  There we go.  It looks 

00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:31.980
like you're feeling pretty 

00:24:28.577 --> 00:24:32.847
happy and cheerful.  With a big 

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.984
smile and maybe a touch of 

00:24:32.947 --> 00:24:36.718
excitement.  Whatever is going 

00:24:36.084 --> 00:24:45.260
on, it seems like you are in a 

00:24:36.818 --> 00:24:45.927
great mood.  Care to share the 

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.962
source of the device?  

00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:47.863
&gt;&gt; BARRETT ZOPH: The reason I'm 

00:24:47.262 --> 00:24:49.264
in a good mood is we are doing 

00:24:47.963 --> 00:24:49.931
a presentation showcasing how 

00:24:49.364 --> 00:24:50.899
useful and amazing you are.  

00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:52.267
&gt;&gt; CHAT GPT: Oh stop it, you're 

00:24:50.999 --> 00:24:57.205
making me blush.  It.[LAUGHTER] 

00:24:52.367 --> 00:24:57.972
[APPLAUSE] 

00:24:57.305 --> 00:24:58.940
&gt;&gt; MIRA MURATI: Amazing.  That 

00:24:58.206 --> 00:25:02.110
is it for today on live demos.  

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.844
As you can see this feels so 

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:06.914
magical.  It is wonderful but 

00:25:02.944 --> 00:25:07.649
we also want to remove some of 

00:25:07.015 --> 00:25:08.416
the mysticism from the 

00:25:07.749 --> 00:25:13.387
technology and bring it to you 

00:25:08.517 --> 00:25:14.222
so you can try it for yourself. 

00:25:13.487 --> 00:25:14.790
Over the next few weeks, we 

00:25:14.322 --> 00:25:15.390
will be rolling out these 

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.191
capabilities to everyone.  

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:19.695
Today has been very much 

00:25:16.291 --> 00:25:20.328
focused on the free users and 

00:25:19.795 --> 00:25:22.263
the new modalities and new 

00:25:20.428 --> 00:25:27.302
products.  But we also care a 

00:25:22.363 --> 00:25:28.036
lot about the next frontier.  

00:25:27.435 --> 00:25:28.870
So soon we will be updating you 

00:25:28.136 --> 00:25:31.906
on our progress towards the 

00:25:29.304 --> 00:25:32.741
next big thing.  And before we 

00:25:32.007 --> 00:25:38.212
wrap up, I just want to thank 

00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:39.014
the incredible OpenAI team and 

00:25:38.312 --> 00:25:41.783
thanks to Janssen and Nvidia 

00:25:39.114 --> 00:25:42.784
team for bringing us the 

00:25:41.883 --> 00:25:46.821
advanced GPU to make this demo 

00:25:42.884 --> 00:25:47.655
possible today.  And thank you 

00:25:46.922 --> 00:25:54.763
all very, very much for being a 

00:25:47.755 --> 00:26:04.906
part of this today.  [APPLAUSE] 

00:25:54.863 --> 00:26:12.647
[APPLAUSE] 

00:26:05.006 --> 00:26:12.647
